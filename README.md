# HugoCademia

Welcome to my portfolio! This page serves as an interactive CV showcasing my skills, projects, job experiences, and published scientific articles.

## About Me

I am a passionate data scientist and product design enthusiast with experience in signal processing, data analysis, machine learning and electronics. I have expertise working with different programming languages, mathematical analyses and visualization tools.

## Website

This project, which I called it from my side `HugoCademia`, works as an academic portfolio website and was developed using the [Hugo Academic Resumé Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) from [**Wowchemy**](https://wowchemy.com), built with the HUGO framework. I took on this journey as a mean of exploring furthermore my knowledge on web framworks and web design in general and at the same time acquiring a portfolio site as a byproduct. The website features:

- `Interactive Design`: The website provides an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, making it easy to navigate and explore my CV and projects.
- `Responsive Layout`: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- `Customization`: The Academic Resumé Template allows for easy customization of the website's content, layout, and styling to match my personal brand.
- `Publications Section`: The website includes a dedicated section to showcase my published scientific articles, providing easy access to the full-text or abstracts of the publications.
- `Project Showcase`: The projects section highlights my notable projects, providing descriptions, roles, and technologies used.
- `Showcase Gallery`: It also counts with a gallery useful for showcasing visual aspects of my projects. Currently, I'm working modding this section of the template plus some curation of the pictures I'm planning to use for this section.

## Deployment

The portfolio website is deployed using `Netlify` and GitHub. `Netlify` allows for continuous deployment and automatic updates whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository. The deployment process ensures that the website is always up-to-date and accessible.
