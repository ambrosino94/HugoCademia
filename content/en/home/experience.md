      * During the 2019 - 2020 academic year I was assigned to the task of teaching 3rd and 4th grade Math from a different modern and updated perspective, implementing gamification methods and technological tools within my classes such as educational platforms like Google Classroom.
      * During the 2020 - 2021 academic year, facing the hardships of COVID-19 pandemic situations, I was given the task of co-coordinate the virtual academic pensum for Mathematics in 5th grade, which I based it on various didactic assignments and activities regarding research and engineer like problem solving.
      * During that same academic year 2020 - 2021, I was also assigned as the only professor of the first programming course in the institution for 10th grade, which led me to design its curricular pensum from scratch focusing it in 3 main areas, one for each trimester:

      - [ ] Programming Introduction with `Processing.js`.
      - [ ] Coding Applications in `Google Spreadsheet`/`AppScript`.
      - [ ] Modern Programming in `Python 3.0`.
