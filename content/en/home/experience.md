      * During this time, while my main role was focused on DSP, I ended up applying a blend of skills more Data Science oriented due to my responsibilities extending into software development, data visualization, and data processing optimization.

      * Designed an intuitive Graphic User Interface (`GUI`) tailored to simplify the management of the detection and denoising stages accommodating data for the classification stage. This `GUI` provided a user-friendly platform for visualizing the outputs of each stage for the project [**"Acoustic recognition of manatee vocalizations"**](https://www.misionmanati.org/).

      * Spearheaded patches and updates to the project, emphasizing on optimizing processing times. Through code enhancements, I reduced processing times from weeks to days, significantly improving project efficiency and accelerating reports, while also establishing version control procedures for the project using `Git` over `MATLAB`, ensuring the traceability and integrity of project code and data.



  - title: DSP Engineer/Researcher Intern
    company: Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)
    company_url: 'https://stri.si.edu/'

    location: Panamá
    date_start: '2017-03-01'

      I was part of the "Acoustic recognition of manatee vocalizations" project, which comprised the development of a data-driven system for the detection and classification of manatee vocalizations. This project laid my foundation in Data Science and showcased my proficiency in advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques.

      Internship contributions:

      * Developed a robust methodology for the automated detection of manatee vocalizations in challenging, underwater noisy environments. This approach heavily relied on the `Autocorrelation Function (ACF)` analysis within `Wavelet Transform` sub-bands.
 
      * Employed a variety of denoising methods, including `Wavelet Shrinkage`, `Signal Subspace` denoising, and `Spectral Subtraction`, to enhance the quality of acoustic data, all which was crucial for improving the accuracy of subsequent `Machine Learning` algorithms.

      * Implemented a high-density database parallel reading routine in `MATLAB` to efficiently manage and organize the vast amount of data generated by the acoustic analysis. This routine utilized dedicated data structures, ensuring access and retrieval of valuable information.
