abstract: This paper documents the effect of the main factors variation that
  alter the launch of a slingshot powered device that throws latex rubber
  bands.  As an exploratory journey into the valuable resources that scientific
  methodology can offer, the author seeks to design an experiment, with simple
  executable treatments, that spans the application of statistical analysis
  creating the road for an inference based in registered data. To achieve this,
  a simple rubber band launcher, conceived under the name of “Lanzelig”, was
  designed, from which it was required to determine, from a methodological
  perspective, if these main factors influence the range of the launcher to
  ensure a specific reached distance of 250cm. This study considered as main
  controllable factors the type of rubber band and the stretch factor, from
  which it was required to design randomized block combinations scoping 40
  launches taking in consideration 2 types of latex rubber bands and 4 different
  stretch factors with 5 replica per combination. The statistical evaluation of
  this study, which covers analysis of variance and t-Student tests, was
  executed using the statistical software InfoStat, showing evidence that
  indicated high influence probability for both factors over the range of the
  device and it was possible to determine which blocks of combinations complied
  with the expected distance.
