abstract: This work presents a methodology to automatically detect and identify
  manatee vocalizations in continuous passive acoustic underwater recordings.
  Given that vocalizations of each manatee present a slightly different
  frequency content, it is possible to identify individuals using a non-invasive
  acoustic approach. The recordings are processed in four stages, including
  detection, denoising, classification, and manatee counting and identification
  by vocalization clustering. The main contribution of this work is considering
  the vocalization spectrogram as an image (i.e., two-dimensional pattern) and
  representing it in terms of principal component analysis coefficients that
  feed a clustering approach. A performance study is carried out for each stage
  of the scheme. The methodology is tested to analyze three years of recordings
  from two wetlands in Panama to support ongoing efforts to estimate the manatee
  population.
